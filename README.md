# **squiggleHERO**


Our Android Mobile App squiggleHERO offers the possibility to doodle on a canvas and save the drawings locally in the phone's local storage. You should be able to scroll through your saved drawings, get into the detail screen of an item and eventually also change the filename and continue drawing on a saved item.


## App usage:
When you open our app, you will enter the main screen that is also the main canvas. 
### **Canvas**:
On the canvas you can start doodling away with 8 different line colors, 3 line sizes, and 8 background colors. You can use an eraser in 3 sizes, and also undo your last lines. The orientation of the app is always in portrait mode.
### **Image Gallery:** 
You can save your images to your app-gallery. There the saved items will be visible and you
can like your favourite squiggles, show ONLY your favourite squiggles, and access each drawing individually. 
**Drawing:** Toggling between brush or backgroundcolors, colours, and between the different sizes of the brush or the eraser, you will need to push the respective button until you reach the desired size of the tool.
### **Detailscreen:** 
When accessing a drawing, you can review it, you can continue drawing, you can delete the drawing, you can rename it if you want and save it to the main gallery of your phone.
### **Languages:** 
The app works completely offline and is available in english and german. For changing the language of the app you will need to change the main language of your phone in the settings.
